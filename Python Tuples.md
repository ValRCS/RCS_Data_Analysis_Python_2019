### Tuple advantages
*  tuple for heterogeneous (different) datatypes and list for homogeneous (similar) datatypes.
* Since tuple are immutable, iterating through tuple is faster than with list. Slight performance boost.
* Tuples that contain immutable elements can be used as key for a dictionary. With list, this is not possible.
* If you have data that doesn't change, implementing it as tuple will guarantee that it remains write-protected
